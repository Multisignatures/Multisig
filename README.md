## Project positioning
Mltisig is a multi signature campaign platform. Any Dao organization can establish a multi signature campaign treasury through mltisig, determine the person in charge of multi signature in the form of campaign, and the person in charge of multi signature will manage the Treasury. Any qualified token holder can sign up for the election of the head of the multi signature Treasury. All the holders of the governance token vote on the candidates in the form of on-line voting, and the winner becomes the person in charge of the multi signature Treasury to manage the funds of the multi signature Treasury.

##Solve what problem

As a multi signature member, a single wallet has great security problems. The purpose of multi signature is to improve the security by requiring multiple parties to reach an agreement on the transaction before execution. Transactions can only be executed after a predefined number of owner confirmations.

## characteristic

#### Multi signature campaign
Users holding governance tokens can apply to run for multi signature members.
#### On chain voting
The governance token holder votes on the members who have applied for election by means of online voting, and the users with more votes will become the members with more signatures.
#### Operation vault
When withdrawing funds from the Treasury, the operation can only be carried out with the consent of multiple members who have reached a predefined number.
